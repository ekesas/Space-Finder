Retail Space Listings

As a Member, you may create Listings. To this end, you will be asked a variety of questions about the Retail Space to be listed, including, but not limited to, the location, capacity, size, features, availability of the Retail Space and pricing and related rules and financial terms. In order to be featured in Listings via the Site, Application and Services, all Retail Space must have valid physical addresses. Listings will be made publicly available via the Site, Application and Services. Other Members will be able to book your Retail Space via the Site, Application and Services based upon the information provided in your Listing. You understand and agree that once a Retailer requests a booking of your Commercial Space, the price for such booking may not be altered for that Retailer.

You acknowledge and agree that you are responsible for any and all Listings you post. Accordingly, you represent and warrant that any Listing you post and the booking of, or Retailer occupation of, a Retail Space in a Listing you post (i) will not breach any agreements you have entered into with any third parties and (ii) will (a) be in compliance with all applicable laws, Tax requirements, and rules and regulations that may apply to any Retail Space included in a Listing you post, including, but not limited to, zoning laws and laws governing rentals of commercial and other properties and (b) not conflict with the rights of third parties, including any contracts relating thereto. Please note that Storefront assumes no responsibility for a Store Owner's compliance with any applicable contracts, laws, rules and regulations. Storefront reserves the right, at any time and without prior notice, to remove or disable access to any Listing for any reason, including Listings that Storefront, in its sole discretion, considers to be objectionable for any reason, in violation of these Terms or otherwise harmful to the Site, Application or Services.

You understand and agree that Storefront does not act as a broker or contracting agent for you as a Store Owner. If a Retailer requests a booking of your Retail Space and occupies that Retail Space, any agreement you enter into with such Retailer is between you and the Retailer and Storefront is not a party thereto. Notwithstanding the foregoing, Storefront serves as the limited authorized agent of the Store Owner for the purpose of accepting payments from Retailers on behalf of the Store Owner and is responsible for transmitting such payments to the Store Owner.

When you create a Listing, you may also choose to include certain requirements which must be met by the Members who are eligible to request a booking of your Retail Space, including, but not limited to, requiring Members to have a profile picture or verified phone number, in order to book your Retail Space. Any Member wishing to book Retail Space included in Listings with such requirements must meet these requirements. More information on how to set such requirements is available via the “Store Owner” section of the Site, Application and Services.

If you are a Store Owner, Storefront makes certain tools available to you to help you to make informed decisions about which Members you choose to confirm for booking for your Retail Space. You acknowledge and agree that, as a Store Owner, you are responsible for your own acts and omissions and are also responsible for the acts and omissions of any individuals who occupy or are otherwise present at the Retail Space at your request or invitation, excluding the Retailer (and the individuals the Retailer invites to the Retail Space, if applicable.)

Storefront recommends that and Store Owners obtain appropriate insurance for their Retail Space. Please review any insurance policy that you may have for your Retail Space carefully, and in particular please make sure that you are familiar with and understand any exclusions to, and any deductibles that may apply for, such insurance policy, including, but not limited to, whether or not your insurance policy will cover the actions or inactions of Retailers (and the individuals the Retailer invites to the Retail Space, if applicable) while at your Retail Space.

No Endorsement

Storefront does not endorse any Members or any Retail Space. In addition, although these Terms require Members to provide accurate information, we do not attempt to confirm, and do not confirm, any Member's purported identity. You are responsible for determining the identity and suitability of others who you contact via the Site, Application and Services. By using the Site, Application or Services, you agree that any legal remedy or liability that you seek to obtain for actions or omissions of other Members or other third parties will be limited to a claim against the particular Members or other third parties who caused you harm and you agree not to attempt to impose liability on, or seek any legal remedy from Storefront with respect to such actions or omissions. Accordingly, we encourage you to communicate directly with other Members on the Site and Services regarding any bookings or Listings made by you. This limitation shall not apply to any claim by a Store Owner against Storefront regarding the remittance of payments received from a Retailer by Storefront on behalf of a Store Owner, which instead shall be subject to the limitations described in the section below entitled “Limitation of Liability”.

Bookings and Financial Terms for Store Owners

If you are a Store Owner and a booking is requested for your Retail Space via the Site, Application and Services, you will be required to either confirm or reject the booking within a commercially reasonable time (as determined by Storefront in its sole discretion, but typically within 24 hours) of when the booking is requested or the booking request will be cancelled. When a booking is requested via the Site, Application and Services, we will share with you (i) the first and last name of the Retailer who has requested the booking and, if applicable, the name of the entity requesting the booking, (ii) a link to the Retailer's Storefront Account profile page, (iii) the names of any members of an SNS with whom you are “friends” or associated on the SNS if such individuals are also “friends” or associated with the Retailer on such SNS, and (iv) an indication that the name that the Retailer provided to Storefront when the Retailer became a Member matches the name that the Retailer provided to the SNSs to which the Retailer has linked his or her Storefront Account, so that you can view such information before confirming or rejecting the booking. If you are unable to confirm or decide to reject a booking of a Retail Space within such 24 hour period, any amounts collected by Storefront for the requested booking will be refunded to the applicable Retailer's credit card and any pre-authorization of such credit card will be released. When you confirm a booking requested by a Retailer, Storefront will send you an email or message via the Application confirming such booking, depending on the selections you make via the Site, Application and Services. The fees displayed in each Listing are comprised of the Retail Space Fees (defined below) and the Retailer Fees (defined below.) Where applicable, Taxes may be charged in addition to the Retail Space Fees and Retailer Fees. The Retail Space Fees, the Retailer Fees and applicable Taxes are collectively referred to in these Terms as the “Total Fees”. The amounts due and payable by a Retailer solely relating to a Store Owner's Retail Space are the “Retail Space Fees”. Please note that it is the Store Owner and not Storefront which determines the Retail Space Fees. The Retail Space Fee may include a cleaning fee, at the Store Owner's discretion.

Retailer Booking and Fees

Storefront charges an administrative fee to Retailers based upon a percentage of applicable Retail Space Fees which are the “Retailer Fees.” The Retailer Fees are added to the Retail Space Fees to calculate the Total Fees (which will also include applicable Taxes) displayed in the applicable Listing. Storefront will collect the Total Fees at the time of booking confirmation (i.e. when the Store Owner confirms the booking within 24 hours of the booking request) and will initiate payment of the Retail Space Fees (less Storefront's Store Owner Fees (defined below)) to the Store Owner within 24 hours of when the occupation of the Retail Space is scheduled to commence (except to the extent that a refund is due to the Retailer).

The Store Owners, not Storefront, are solely responsible for honoring any confirmed bookings and making available any Retail Space reserved through the Site, Application and Services.

Rental Agreements between Store Owners and Retailers

By confirming a Retail Space via the Storefront service, each party agrees to honor term, and the amount of money that the Retailer will pay the Store Owner, as specified when the Store Owner accepted the Retailer's request for the Retail Space.

Storefront encourages every Store Owner to have the Retailer sign a formal short-term license for the use of the space. Storefront provides short-term license and lease agreements that contain industry standard wording that you can use as default agreements. By agreeing to the terms contained in these agreements, the parties agree to honor them.

Keep in mind, however, that Storefront, does not require you to use a particular contract and Storefront is not liable for any content or omissions contained in the contracts it provides. Storefront recommends that each party review any contracts with a qualified third-party attorney prior to signing.

For an example of a standard license agreement used by Storefront users, see www.thestorefront.com/contracts

Appointment of Storefront as Payment Agent for Store Owner

Each Store Owner hereby appoints Storefront as the Store Owner's limited agent solely for the purpose of collecting payments made by Retailers on behalf of the Store Owner. Each Store Owner agrees that payment made by a Retailer to Storefront shall be considered the same as a payment made directly to the Store Owner and the Store Owner will make the Retail Space available to Retailer in the agreed upon manner as if the Store Owner has received the Retail Space Fees. Each Store Owner agrees that, Storefront may, in accordance with the cancellation policy selected by the Store Owner (i) permit the Retailer to cancel the booking and (ii) refund to the Retailer that portion of the Retail Space Fees specified in the applicable cancellation policy. In accepting appointment as the limited authorized agent of the Store Owner, Storefront assumes no liability for any acts or omissions of the Store Owner.

All Store Owners who license their Retail Space through the Service must receive payment through the Service. Storefront will terminate a use of the Website if such Store Owner is found to be accepting payment outside the Service for Retail Space licensed through the Service.

Please note that Storefront does not currently charge fees for the creation of Listings. However, you acknowledge and agree that Storefront reserves the right, in its sole discretion, to charge you for and collect fees from you for the creation of Listings. Please note that Storefront will provide notice of any Listing fee via the Site, Application and Services, prior to implementing such a Listing fee feature.

Security Deposits

Store Owners may choose if they require a security deposit from the Retailer, however Storefront is not responsible for administering or accepting any claims by Store Owners, related to Security Deposits, and disclaims any and all liability in this regard.

Bookings and Financial Terms for Retailers

Retailers agree to pay Storefront the Total Fees for any booking confirmed via the Service. Prior to the Space owner confirming such a booking, Store Owners understand and agree that Storefront is permitted to obtain a pre-authorization of the payment for the Total Fees and bank account verification is required to confirm the Retailer's identity and ability to pay in order for the booking request to be submitted to the Store Owner.

Once Storefront receives confirmation of your booking from the applicable Store Owner, Storefront will collect the Total Fees in accordance with the terms and conditions of these Terms and the pricing terms set forth in the applicable Listing.

Cancellations and Refunds

If, as a Retailer, you cancel your requested booking before the requested Retail Space is confirmed by a Store Owner, Storefront will cancel any pre-authorization to your credit card and/or refund any nominal amounts charged to your credit card in connection with the requested booking within a commercially reasonable time.

If, as a Retailer, you wish to cancel a confirmed booking made via the Site, Application and Services, either prior to or after arriving at the Retail Space, the cancellation policy of the Store Owner contained in the applicable Listing will apply to such cancellation. Storefront's ability to refund the booking fees and other amounts charged to you will depend upon the terms of the applicable cancellation policy selected by the Store Owner. Storefront's Fees will be refunded. If a Store Owner cancels a confirmed booking made via the Site, Services, and Application, Storefront will refund the Total Fees for such booking to the applicable Retailer within a commercially reasonable time after the cancellation. Insurance Offered to Retailers

Storefront currently offers Retailers short-term general liability offered to sellers that provides Retailers with excess general liability insurance at a standard coverage of $1,000,000 and up to $5,000,000 per policy period, so long as the Retailers are in compliance with this Agreement. In order for this policy to apply to Retailers, Retailers are required to opt into it by following the instructions provided to them by Storefront after their request for a Retail Space is accepted. The insurance policy offers excess general liability protection over a Retailer's existing insurance while such Retailer is licensing Retail Space through the Service and covers product damage, personal and advertising injury, damage to the premises and medical payments. As with any insurance policy, additional insurance terms, limitations, and exclusions apply. For more information about our insurance policy, please visit thestorefront.com/insurance.

THIS IS AN UNOFFICIAL SUMMARY OF STOREFRONT'S MASTER INSURANCE POLICY AND MAY NOT ALWAYS BE UP-TO-DATE. NONE OF THE STATEMENTS IN THIS SECTION SHOULD BE INTERPRETED AS BINDING AND ARE PROVIDED FOR QUICK REFERENCE.
