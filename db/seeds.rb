Throw in the Arcadia (three blocks south), the 5100 Club (three blocks to the north), and the Rainbo at Lawrence and Clark, Chicagoans from all over the city would flock to this area to dance, drink, dine, catch a show or take in a movie.\n\nWhile most of these venues have met with the wrecking ball since Uptown's heyday, the Lawrence and Broadway core has remained intact and, with the presence of the Aragon, Riviera and Green Mill, still serves as a great place to visit for live entertainment. Unfortunately, the neighborhood's biggest gem, the Uptown Theatre, has been sitting vacant since 1981 and has become a sore topic for residents of the neighborhood, many of who would like to see it restored to it's former majesty. \n\nThere is hope, though, for the Uptown Theatre and the area surrounding these historic venues. Since taking office earlier this year, Mayor Rahm Emanuel has stated that he'd like Uptown to recapture it's former identity as premier entertainment destination. Here is an article that recently ran in the Chicago Tribune on the subject: Uptown Theatre: Polishing an old jewel"},
#   {name: "Wrigleyville", photo_url: "http://lakeshorepublicmedia.org/wp-content/uploads/2013/07/Wrigley.jpg", photo2_url: "http://a.espncdn.com/photo/2013/0122/chi_wrigley_renderings_05.jpg", description: "Formerly a working-class neighborhood, Wrigleyville is the nickname to the neighborhood directly surrounding Wrigley Field. Also known as Central Lakeview, its borders run from Cornelia Avenue and Irving Park Road, to Halsted Street and Racine Avenue. Wrigleyville features low-rise brick buildings and houses, some with rooftop bleachers colloquially called Wrigley Rooftops where people can purchase seats to watch baseball games or concerts that, while generally more expensive than tickets for seats within the park itself, come with all you can eat and drink service. Proprietors are able to do so under special agreements with the Chicago Cubs organization. Many Wrigleyville bars and restaurants (particularly on North Clark Street) feature sports-oriented themes. Bars such as Sluggers, Murphy's Bleachers, Casey Moran's, Rockwood Place, Sports Corner and The Cubby Bear host the Cubs crowds near the Wrigley Field intersection of North Clark Street and West Addison Street."},

Phillip Rogers, after becoming familiar with the area by working with and trading with the local tribes, purchased approximately 1,600 acres of this land from the government between the 1830s and 1860s with the intention of developing it for future settlement. \n\nThe area saw an influx of European settlers during these years, many of them working on farms, which was Rogers Park's main industry at the time. In 1878, after continuing population growth, Rogers Park was incorporated as a village, and 15 years later the area was annexed into Chicago."},
#   {name: "Albany Park", photo_url: "http://upload.wikimedia.org/wikipedia/commons/1/19/Albany_Park_stn_signage.JPG", photo2_url: "http://payload82.cargocollective.com/1/5/170224/3952871/AlbanyPark.jpg", description: "Albany Park, with \"one of highest percentages of foreign-born residents\" in the city, is considered to be Chicago's most diverse community area. The area, which contains a \"vast panorama of ethnic shops and eateries,\" ranging from Mexican to Thai, Korean to Middle Eastern, and countless others, wasn't always this diverse. Albany Park \"grew from a sparsely settled farming community to a dynamic urban neighborhood in the course of one generation,\" and by the early 1900s, aided by the presence of transportation lines that linked it to the rest of the city, the neighborhood began to see an uptick in commercial development and an increased number of residents moving into the area. \"German and Swedish immigrants initially settled the area,\" and by 1912, the community became home to a large number of Russian Jews that were \"leaving the crowded neighborhoods of Chicago's Near West Side.\"\n\nRemaining predominantly Jewish through the 1950s, the area saw a shift in demographics when, \"like the generation before them, many of these Jewish families moved north, this time to suburban Lincolnwood and Skokie.\" In the 1970s Albany Park became a \"port of entry for immigrants from Asia and Latin America,\" and by the 1990s \"the community area claimed the largest numbers of Korean, Filipino, and Guatemalan immigrants in Chicago.\""},
#   {name: "Avondale", photo_url: "http://justyna.typepad.com/photos/uncategorized/2008/06/06/p1000879.jpg", photo2_url: "http://payload44.cargocollective.com/1/5/170224/3194980/Avondale.jpg", description: "Historically a working-class community, Avondale has been characterized as a “neighborhood of smokestacks and steeples.” Making up the \"smokestacks\" half of this were the numerous companies that set up shop and produced goods here for the entire country. Avondale was home to the factories for Florsheim Shoes, Olson Rug, and Dad's Root Beer, among others, all of who took advantage of the neighborhood's proximity to the Chicago River and the city's extensive rail network.\n\nAvondale's Basilica of St. Hyacinth (pictured above) and the nearby St. Wenceslaus help illustrate the second half of the \"smokestacks and steeples\" characterization. The two massive churches are gathering places not only for the Poles in Avondale, but also for Poles throughout the rest of Chicago and the surrounding areas. \n\nThese Poles, \"who have today become synonymous with Avondale,\" first arrived in the area in the 1890s. Their arrival helped solidify Chicago's infamous \"Polish Corridor (Milwaukee Avenue),\" and made the neighborhood a port of entry for many arriving immigrants. While Avondale has been experiencing gentrification in recent years, \"much of its Polish character, with Polish bakeries, restaurants, businesses and even a department store visible in its landscape,\" remains strong.\n"},
#   {name: "Belmont Central", photo_url: "http://upload.wikimedia.org/wikipedia/commons/5/53/Chicago_trolleybus_9680_on_Belmont_in_1968.jpg", photo2_url: "http://farm4.static.flickr.com/3130/2894438124_de9830b412.jpg", description: "The community area that is now known as Belmont Cragin is one that was built on commerce and industry. Slow to develop after the first settlers put down roots in the latter part of the 1800s, the abundance of wide open spaces helped attract numerous manufacturing businesses to the region. The presence of these companies with large workforces prompted railroads to be built that would reach the area, and in turn, these new railroads helped spur residential growth in the surrounding neighborhoods.\n\nThe mid-1900s saw a drop in manufacturing employment that was so important to the neighborhood's early growth, but the 1976 opening of the Brickyard Shopping Mall, on the former site of the Carey Brickyard property, \"added new vitality to the community.\" To further aid in the revitalization of the neighborhood, Belmont Cragin residents organized a \"home reinvestment campaign\" and also studied ways to \"revive the commercial climate in the area.\"\n"},

The Center on Halsted, an LGBT community center, is also located in this area.\n\nBoystown is known for its colorful, lively nightlife and inviting atmosphere. Boystown also includes some of Chicago's off-Loop theater, specialty restaurants, greystone and brownstone walk-up buildings and other historic architecture, trendy fashion outlets, wine boutiques, chain stores, and independent shops. The city's annual Gay and Lesbian Pride Parade begins at the intersection of Montrose and Broadway, runs south along Broadway then Halsted to Belmont, turns east on Belmont to Broadway again, then south to Diversey, and then east to Sheridan Road."},
